## Key areas of expertise

With a strong background in NodeJS and React, I’m currently offering services in the following areas:

- Establishing effective frontend teams, or scaling existing teams
- Mentoring junior frontend developers, or backend developers moving to frontend work
- Refactoring existing React applications for better maintainability and performance
- Frontend and backend-for-frontend architecture / systems design
- Typescript monorepo tooling and continuous integration setup or improvements
- Complex custom component development, specialising in data-visualisation

## Technologies of choice

My strongest stacks are JavaScript / Typescript, ReactJS, and NodeJS based. I have plenty of experience in various CI, monorepo, and testing frameworks in this ecosystem.

## Ways of working together

- **Solo**. I am a very intrinsically motivated person, and have a proven track record delivering high-quality work with little guidance. I proactively ask the right questions, and know where to look for answers. I am also able to summarize and explain my findings, in such a way that you can follow my progress without being burdened with the day-to-day minutiae of the project.

- **Enhancing your team**. Peers see me as an extremely productive contributor who is pleasant to work with. My technical skills are boosted by the capacity to effectively collaborate with others: I feel comfortable mentoring junior programmers, solving architectural challenges with experienced developers, interfacing with business stakeholders, and more. If you are looking to enhance your team, I’d be happy to be on board.

## Practicalities

- **Location**. I am based in Waterford, Ireland and have a preference for remote work.
  Working across time zones. I have experience collaborating with colleagues in different time zones (US and Europe).

- **Working hour**. I am interested in projects for 2 to 5 days a week, 8 hours a day.

- **Languages**. I am a native English speaker.
