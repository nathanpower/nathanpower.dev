# Hi There & Welcome to My Corner of the Web!

I'm Nathan Power, a web developer from Waterford, Ireland. Coding since my teens, I turned my love for programming into a profession after earning my Computer Science degree.

I've helped build ambitious, widely-used software for companies like [Nearform](https://nearform.com) and [Wayflyer](https://wayflyer.com). I now focus on building effective frontend teams, implementing design systems, and consulting - while staying very hands-on with the code.

Ready to work together? Get in touch!
